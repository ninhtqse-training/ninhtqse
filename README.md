## Web Developer (JS, PHP & AWS)

### About Me

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm ninhtqse, a passionate developer with a strong background in JavaScript, PHP, and AWS.

With several years of experience in web development, I have honed my skills in building scalable and efficient applications using JavaScript and PHP. I enjoy working on both front-end and back-end development, crafting interactive user interfaces, and designing robust server-side architectures.

In addition to my programming skills, I have extensive knowledge of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and its various services. From deploying applications on EC2 instances to managing data with S3 and DynamoDB, I am well-versed in leveraging the power of AWS to build secure and scalable cloud-based solutions.

I constantly strive to stay updated with the latest technologies and best practices in software development. I am a strong believer in clean code, test-driven development, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) methodologies.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing my knowledge through technical articles and tutorials.

Feel free to explore my repositories and get in touch with me if you have any interesting projects or collaboration opportunities. Let's build amazing things together!
